This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo `next-boilerplate` in the bitbucket workspace with the suitable name
2. Clone the forked repo to your local system
3. Install all the dependencies & dev-dependences using the command:
   `yarn (We are using yarn package manager)`

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Make sure you have configured `prettier` extension in your editor, if not then please install prettier extension on your code editor.

```
  Check rules for prettier (VS Code):
  1. 2 spaced tabs for all your code files
  2. Go to your editor settings and search for prettier in the settings
  3. Check the following items
    a. Mark Prettier: Semi to checked (For adding semicolons)
    b. Set Prettier: Tabs to 2
    c. Set Prettier: Trailing Comma to es5
    d. Mark Prettier: Use Editor Config to checked
    e. Mark Prettier: Enable to checked
    f. Mark Prettier: Bracket Spacing to checked
    g. Set Include Parenthesis Around a Sole Arrow Function to always
  4. These are main settings that we require for prettier. It automatically formats the code and takes care of missing commas, parenthesis, etc. and makes your code look cleaner and in the format we look for.
